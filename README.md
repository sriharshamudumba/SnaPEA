# SnaPEA
SnaPEA is an innovative framework designed to optimize neural network inference by dynamically skipping redundant activations, resulting in faster computation and reduced resource usageâ€”all while maintaining or improving model accuracy.

Key Features
Accelerated Inference:
ResNet: Achieved a 74% speedup (runtime reduced from 20.12s to 5.19s) with an improved accuracy of 92.53%.
GoogLeNet: Delivered a 67% speedup (runtime reduced from 17.66s to 5.83s) with 88.51% accuracy.
VGG-Net: Improved inference time by 68% (runtime reduced from 22.46s to 7.10s) with an accuracy of 87.32%.
Seamless Integration: Built on top of popular AI frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch, making it easy to integrate into existing workflows.
Resource Efficiency: Reduces computational overhead, paving the way for scalable and energy-efficient AI systems.
How It Works
SnaPEA leverages the sparsity in neural activations during inference. By dynamically identifying and pruning non-contributing activations, it minimizes unnecessary computations, achieving significant performance gains.

Why Use SnaPEA?
Speed: Faster inference for real-time applications.
Efficiency: Optimized resource utilization for edge devices.
Scalability: Supports a wide range of neural network architectures.
